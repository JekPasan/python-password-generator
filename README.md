# python-password-generator
a simple password generator written in python

Hello, this is one of my first project, as I've recently been getting really into programming.
This is just to test out what I've learnt so far.
Any criticism is welcomed.

When inputing the parameters which you want to be included within the password they need to look something like: "x,y,z,etc". The program breaks if you use spaces.
